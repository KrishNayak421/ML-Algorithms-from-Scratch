# ML Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to **ML Algorithms from Scratch** â€“ a repository dedicated to implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms without relying on high-level libraries. By building these algorithms from the ground up, I can gain deeper insights into how they work and develop a stronger understanding of the underlying principles.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Linear Regression from Scratch**  
  A simple implementation of linear regression using gradient descent.

- **Logistic Regression from Scratch**  
  A simple implementation of logistic regression using gradient descent for binary classification.

- **KNN (K Nearest Neighbours) from Scratch**
(In Progress)
