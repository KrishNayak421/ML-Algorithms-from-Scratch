## Main README (README.md)

```markdown
# ML Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to **ML Algorithms from Scratch** – a repository dedicated to implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms without relying on high-level libraries. By building these algorithms from the ground up, you can gain deeper insights into how they work and develop a stronger understanding of the underlying principles.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Linear Regression from Scratch**  
  A simple implementation of linear regression using gradient descent.
- _(More algorithms coming soon!)_

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You will also need the following packages:

- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
````

### Running the Code

Navigate to the algorithm folder and run the corresponding script. For example, to run the linear regression model:

```bash
cd Linear_Regression
python linear_regression.py
```

## Linear Regression README (Linear_Regression/README.md)

```markdown
# Linear Regression from Scratch

This folder contains a linear regression model built from scratch using Python. The implementation uses gradient descent to optimize the model parameters by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Overview

Linear Regression is one of the simplest yet most powerful techniques for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). In this implementation, we use gradient descent to find the best fit line defined by the equation:

\[
\hat{y} = w \times x + b
\]

where:
- \(w\) is the slope (weight)
- \(b\) is the intercept (bias)

## Implementation Details

### Loss Function

The loss (or error) is measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

\[
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(y_i - (w \times x_i + b)\right)^2
\]

### Gradient Descent

Gradient descent iteratively updates the parameters \(w\) and \(b\) using the gradients of the loss function:

\[
w := w - \alpha \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial w} \quad \text{and} \quad b := b - \alpha \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b}
\]

where \(\alpha\) is the learning rate.

### Code Example

Below is a simplified version of the implementation:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import time

# Load training data
data = pd.read_csv("train.csv")

def loss_function(w, b, points):
    total_error = 0
    for i in range(len(points)):
        x = points.iloc[i].feature
        y = points.iloc[i].target
        total_error += (y - (w * x + b))**2
    total_error = total_error / float(len(points))
    return total_error

def gradient_descent(w_now, b_now, points, L):
    w_gradient = 0
    b_gradient = 0
    n = len(points)
    for i in range(n):
        x = points.iloc[i].feature
        y = points.iloc[i].target
        w_gradient += (-2 / n) * x * (y - (w_now * x + b_now))
        b_gradient += (-2 / n) * (y - (w_now * x + b_now))

    w = w_now - w_gradient * L
    b = b_now - b_gradient * L

    return w, b

# Initialize parameters
w = 0
b = 0
L = 0.0001
epochs = 1000

# Training loop
for i in range(epochs):
    w, b = gradient_descent(w, b, data, L)
    if i % 50 == 0:
        print("Epoch:", i, "Loss:", loss_function(w, b, data))
print("Final parameters:", w, b)

# Visualization
plt.scatter(data.feature, data.target, color="red", label="Data")
plt.plot(range(0, 100), [w * x + b for x in range(0, 100)], color="black", label="Fit")
plt.xlabel("Feature")
plt.ylabel("Target")
plt.title("Linear Regression Fit")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
````

## How to Run

1. **Prepare the Data:**  
   Ensure that `train.csv` is in the same directory as the code and contains columns named `feature` and `target`.

2. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```

   The script will output the loss at regular intervals during training, display the final parameters, and show a plot of the data points along with the regression line.

## Future Improvements

- Extend the model to support multiple features.
- Implement regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
- Add more robust error handling and visualization.
